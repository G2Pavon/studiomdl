## studiomdl++

C++ fork of fnky studiomdl

- Removed unused code
- 64 bit
- UV shift correction (using DoomMusic's fix and removing texture resizing hack, didn't test too much to confirm if it works well tbh)

>Note: developed on linux

>Note: Your QC and SMD files has to use LF (Unix) line-endings in order to work.
