## studiomdl++

This is a C++ port forked from fnky studiomdl

- 64 bit support
- FunnkyHD and DoomMusic's UV shift correction (with some tweaks to match svenstudiomdl's UV, also i haven't done a deep test to verify if it works since i only test with 1 mdl cs_italy's chick.mdl.)

>Note: Your QC and SMD files has to use LF (Unix) line-endings in order to work.
